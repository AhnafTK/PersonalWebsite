        This program is a simple card game that autogenerates a deck of cards for the user, and an opponent.
        Each card has a number, that ranges from 1-10. The user and opponent each have 3 cards. The winner 
        is determined by adding the numbers of the cards, and seeing who has the highest number.

        Weight Plate Calculator is an excercise tool that calculates the number of
        weight plates needed for a given weight. For example, The user wants to load
        their barbell for a 135 lbs bench press. They'd need to input the total weight
        of 135 and the barbell weight of 45. Using these two numbers, the program
        calculates the weight of plates, and how many the user needs.
        <br> The calculation is done through a series of while loops, which pulls data from
        data from arrays. The arrays are then used to calculate the number of plates needed.
        <h4>  uses: Arrays, while-loops, Java Swing. </h4>
