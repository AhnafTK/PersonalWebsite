      <h3>Weight Plate Calculator</h3>
      <p>
        Weight Plate Calculator is an excercise tool that calculates the number of
        weight plates needed for a given weight. For example, The user wants to load
        their barbell for a 135 lbs bench press. They'd need to input the total weight
        of 135 and the barbell weight of 45. Using these two numbers, the program
        calculates the weight of plates, and how many the user needs.
        
        <br>
        Example:
        </br>
        <br> Total weight = 225</br>
        <br> Barbell weight = 45</br>
